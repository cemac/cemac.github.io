# JASMIN TAPE

*Coming soon NLDS*

Due to space constraints, tape may need to be used on JASMIN

GWS by default have access to tape for additional users you must email the helpdesk

The easiest way to access the tape storage is via JDMA. [Link to JDMA documentation](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/docs/short-term-project-storage/jdma/)

## setting up JDMA

```python
python -m venv ~/venvs/jdma-venv
source ~/venvs/jdma-venv/bin/activate
pip install git+https://github.com/cedadev/jdma_client
jdma init <email> -w <group-workspace-name>
```

## Using JDMA

to view the tape storage by showing every get and put command 

`jdma request -f workspace -w <gws-name>`

Each batch ID is a separate folder sent to tape, ideally, you label the folder that is being sent to tape something useful or tar'ed up folders with descriptive names. 

### To view files in a batch:

```
jdma -t files <batch-id>
```

you'll probably need to pipe a grep command to help find single files, the least messy way would be to have batch ids to be single tarred folders that you out and fetch as one unit.

### to send to tape:

````
jdma -s elastictape -w <group-workspace-name> migrate <foldername>
````

if the folder is not in the top level of the gws make sure to give full path to it.

### To fetch from tape

Create a directory in which to put the folder in **This is very important**, find the batch ID and then give a list of files or easier just the whole top-level folder to stop things from getting messy.

```
 jdma -r jdma_downloads/ get <batch-id> <filelist.txt>
```

If you do not send to a separate folder the file permission can go haywire a lock the whole group out the the gws.

## IMPORTANT TIPS

* Never make a blank get request this will mess up the permissions of the entire gws for everyone!
* Always create a new folder to which the got items will go. 
* Keep everything in clearly labelled folders separate for batch id
* Never access the same batch id at the same time as anyone else - only the help desk can fix this.
* for ease of access break things up or tar stuff e.g. restarts w1, w2, w3 separately so the tape storage is less of a maze to navigate
