## School Linux systems

A document which covers lots of useful information for getting started with using Linux, and includes specific information about using the systems within the School of Earth and Environment, is available here:

[https://github.com/cemacrr/linux_intro/raw/master/document.pdf](https://github.com/cemacrr/linux_intro/raw/master/document.pdf)

This document also includes some notes which may be useful for those wishing to set up their own Anaconda installations.

## Remote access

Some notes regarding remote access to systems within the School are available here:

[Remote Access](https://github.com/cemac/cemac_generic/wiki/Remote-Access)

## ARC

The Leeds HPC systems are documented here:

[https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/](https://arc.leeds.ac.uk/)

Details of applying for access to the systems can be found here:

## JASMIN

The JASMIN systems, which provide various things, including data storage, access to data sets, interactive and batch computing systems, as well as 'cloud' type services are likely to be available for use by most members of the School, are documented here:

[https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/)

The 'Getting Started' section might be a good place to start for new users:

## Carpentries

The Carpentries sessions (which you may have attended, or may have an opportunity to attend in the future) provide very helpful notes for getting started with using a shell / Python / R / Git. etc.

The session notes are available via this page:
