## AIRE

The Leeds HPC systems are documented here:

[https://arcdocs.leeds.ac.uk/aire/welcome.html](https://arcdocs.leeds.ac.uk/aire/welcome.html)


## Carpentries

The Carpentries sessions (which you may have attended, or may have an opportunity to attend in the future) provide very helpful notes for getting started with using a shell / Python / R / Git. etc.

The session notes are available via this page:

* [https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/](https://software-carpentry.org/lessons/)
* [https://cemac.github.io/sc-python/](https://cemac.github.io/sc-python/)
* [https://cemac.github.io/sc-git/](https://cemac.github.io/sc-git)
* [https://cemac.github.io/sc-shell/](https://cemac.github.io/sc-shell/)

## School Linux systems

**The school Linux systems are currently undergoing a major overhaul, and so our notes are no longer up-to-date**. The notes below are now deprecated but still contain lots of useful information for getting started with using Linux, but **specific information about using the systems within the School of Earth and Environment will not be relevant**, is available here:

This document also includes some notes which may be useful for those wishing to set up their own Anaconda installations.

## Remote access

**Remote access to Leeds systems is currently undergoing changes, and we have not written up-to-date notes**, our old mostly deprecated notes are available here:
